# iESTIMATE computational analysis framework for Eco-Metabolomics data
iESTIMATE = Identifying ESsenTIal Molecular vAriables in Terrestrial Ecology

Version: 0.2

## Use-cases
The iESTIMATE framework has been developed to be applied to eco-metabolomics studies to answer a wide range of research questions. The following use-cases demonstrate the power of the framework:
- [Impact of hormone treatments on the metabolome of Radula complanata](https://github.com/ipb-halle/iESTIMATE/blob/main/use-cases/radula-hormones/)
- [Chemical Diversity and Classification of Secondary Metabolites in Nine Bryophyte Species](https://github.com/ipb-halle/iESTIMATE/tree/main/use-cases/mtbls709)

## TODO
- modularize
- create CWL-based workflow
- make workflow FAIR

## History

### Version 0.2:
- added MTBLS709 study
