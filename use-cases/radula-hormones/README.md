## Raw data
Raw metabolomics data has been deposited in MetaboLights and is available under the identifier MTBLS3563.

## Description
Liverworts are a group of non-vascular plants that possess oil bodies which are unique organelles designed to store specialized metabolites that are cytotoxic to the host. These metabolites have a variety of interesting structural and biochemical characteristics, however the fluctuations of these metabolites in response to stresses is largely unknown. 

This dataset investigates the impact of metabolic stress on the leafy liverwort Radula complanata, the five phytohormones abscisic acid (AA), methyl jasmonate (JA), salicylic acid (SA), 1-napthaleneacitic acid (NAA), and 6_benzylaminopurine (BAP) were exogenously applied and untargeted metabolomics was conducted. Compound classification and identification were performed with CANOPUS and SIRIUS, respectively. Data analyses included PCA, variable selection using BORUTA and univariate post-hoc Tukey test on a one-way ANOVA.
